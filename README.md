## Description

This project is an interactive full-stack application that adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. It utilizes JavaScript and connects to a cloud-based MySQL database. The project features a sophisticated back-end and a straightforward front-end. It's hosted on Heroku for ease of use. The primary objective of this project was to develop a tech blog platform where users can publish posts, comment on them, and delete their posts or comments.

### Requirements

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables
